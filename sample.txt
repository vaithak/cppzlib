### How Claude Shannon Invented the Future?

Science seeks the basic laws of nature. Mathematics searches for new theorems to build upon the old. 
Engineering builds systems to solve human needs. 
The three disciplines are interdependent but distinct. 
Very rarely does one individual simultaneously make central contributions to all three — 
but Claude Shannon was a rare individual.

Despite being the subject of the recent documentary The Bit Player — and someone 
whose work and research philosophy have inspired my own career — Shannon 
is not exactly a household name. He never won a Nobel Prize, and he wasn’t a 
celebrity like Albert Einstein or Richard Feynman, either before or after his death in 2001. 
But more than 70 years ago, in a single groundbreaking paper, he laid the foundation 
for the entire communication infrastructure underlying the modern information age.

Shannon was born in Gaylord, Michigan, in 1916, the son of a local businessman 
and a teacher. After graduating from the University of Michigan with degrees 
in electrical engineering and mathematics, he wrote a master’s thesis at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology that applied a mathematical discipline 
called Boolean algebra to the analysis and synthesis of switching circuits. 
It was a transformative work, turning circuit design from an art into a science, 
and is now considered to have been the starting point of digital circuit design.

Communication is one of the most basic human needs. From smoke signals to carrier 
pigeons to the telephone to television, humans have always sought methods that would 
allow them to communicate farther, faster and more reliably. 
But the engineering of communication systems was always tied to the specific source and 
physical medium. Shannon instead asked, “Is there a grand unified theory for communication?” 
In a 1939 letter to his mentor, Vannevar Bush, Shannon outlined some of his initial ideas 
on “fundamental properties of general systems for the transmission of intelligence.” 
After working on the problem for a decade, Shannon finally published his masterpiece 
in 1948: “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.”
